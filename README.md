Firstly to install clone the project at the following link

https://github.com/Jackisapi/gpt4all-cli

once cloned assuming you have python3 and pip installed 
run the following command

pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs all of the modules used by this program and at there correct versions

After this you simply run python3 (sometimes just python) main.py (or on windows sometimes its py or py3)

Now that the program is installed lets go into how it works 

type anything that isn't an official command to queue a task to the model 

ls - lists all the current compatible models and data relating to them

ch - changes the model you are currently on (ls is usable still)

hw - prints all the hardware compute options then takes an input to change what hardware is being used for compute if no correct input is made it will simply default to what it was originally

exit - allows you to exit the program
